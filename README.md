# `GIVE YOUR STRENGTH`

This is my backend NSS capstone project designed to implement a full stack React to Python/Django app with maps.

## `What is GYS?`

Ths idea behind GYS is based on my time as a caretaker and realizing the important need for physical strength. I thought to myself, it would be quite handy to know if someone near me was in need. Whether that's to get in and out of bed, to get up from a fall, or even to carry some groceries inside.

Users sign up as Giveing or Needing strength. Their addresses are geocoded. Then a map is rendered with the opposite help type within a certain distance.

For exmaple, if you can GIVE strength, you can see all the users within 3 miles of your lat/long who NEED help.

The app is not unlike other apps. We capture user data, put it in a database, pull that data back out, and put it on a map. It's a simple app, but was a challenge nonetheless.
